This is a proof of concept for how to use a problem I've seen referred to as "longest common substring" to display the diff between two different strings. 

I was inspired to play around with this idea when I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SP_AY7GGxw) about how to use an academic CS concept called dynamic programming in real life.
